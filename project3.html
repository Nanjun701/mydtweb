    <h5>Project 3: Experimental Clock</h5>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I love to cook and usually I need to thaw frozen meats ahead of time. It usually takes about three hours to thaw a pork belly. I wanted to represent the passage of time with the process of melting the ice.</p>
    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>I find it interesting to think about replacing invisible information with a visual method. But I'm not quite sure how to get clock to reset or opacity to start at 190 every time I upload.</p>
