  <h5>Digital Divination</h5>
  <h3>Proposal</h3>
  <p>This project, titled “Jade Court Mandate,” is an interactive divination test rooted in Chinese mythology and the Five Elements. Having explored countless ancient Chinese mythic tales and been deeply enchanted by the Heavenly Court and its immortals, I wanted to recreate that fantastical atmosphere in a digital form. In many legends, deities who commit misdeeds in Heaven are cast down to the mortal realm to undergo trials before ascending once more. In this test, users first select a guardian spirit (such as the Deer Spirit, Dragon Spirit, or Crane Spirit), then choose one of the Five Elements. The system then generates the user’s former heavenly office by combining classic stories of divine “offenses” with the virtues of the chosen element. The entire experience blends ritualistic gravitas with modern interaction design, forging a magical bridge between ancient myth and contemporary digital engagement.</p>
