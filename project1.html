    <h5>Project 1: Lost and Found</h5>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>My item (from Malaz) is a diary that was the size of a regular notebook, it was pink and had some sparkles on it. it had a brown on the top and a lock on the side.</p>
    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>The language Malaz used was very clear, so I can easily get what the item looks like. Since the shapes of the items are not complicated, I felt that the drawing went relatively smoothly. The only thing I found a little difficult was how to draw the sparkles on the notebook. this time I just drew a lot of tiny circles to represent the sparkles. it's done, but I hope I can learn an easier way to draw them in the future.
        Also, the translate function that I learned in the last lesson is very useful. It helps me move items to the center of the canvas while I don't have to do complicated coordinate calculations.</p>
