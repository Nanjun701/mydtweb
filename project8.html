  <h5>Experimental Typography</h5>
  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>The look of a word has an enormous impact on how we understand the word. For centuries, calligraphers and typographers have explored and developed different ways to make type more expressive. Living in an era where computer programming has become increasingly accessible to designers, typography has adopted the principles of modular and parameterized design and became more interactive.

    For Project #2, you will pick three different words to create three interactive posters. Incorporate textToPoints() and / or classes and objects in the sketches. Your choice of shape, color, motion, and interaction should thoughtfully reflect on the meaning of the word.</p>
  <ul> 
    <li class="li2"><a href="p8passion.html">Word 1: Passion</a></li> 
    <li class="li2"><a href="p8realworld.html">Word 2: Real World</a></li>
    <li class="li2"><a href="p8nanjun.html">Word 3: Nanjun</a></li>
