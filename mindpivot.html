    <h3>Inspiration and Background</h3>
    <p>Under the pressure of modern fast-paced lifestyles, many people find themselves overwhelmed with endless to-do lists and trapped in cycles of emotional overthinking. This state of mind makes it difficult to focus on what truly matters and leaves little space for meaningful rest or emotional expression.
        While digital task management tools are widely available, they often function as rigid reminders of unfinished tasks, offering little to no emotional support. Instead of helping users manage their workload and state of mind, these tools may unintentionally add to their stress and anxiety. 
        I want to create a tool that understands and supports these needs. It will help users step away from unproductive emotional spirals, offering a gentle nudge toward clarity and focus. At the same time, it will encourage healthy breaks and create space for personal reflection. This tool is not about relentless productivity; itâ€™s about creating a moment of balance, helping people navigate their tasks while staying in tune with their emotional well-being.</p>
