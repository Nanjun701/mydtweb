    <h5>Autobiographical Game: Lens Journey</h5>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>During my first year in New York, my school went on a month-long strike and I was so bored that I planned to do something fun. My friends always told me that I was good at taking pictures, so I decided then to try to become a photographer. This game is about how I started by buying a camera, then managed to take a lot of orders from customers, to now I decided to take professional photography classes and buy a new camera.
        (Specific story: buying a used camera - trying to shoot for the first time on Halloween (for free) - shooting in various places in NYC - small gains - deciding to further my skills)
        The game is set on a map of New York City to show my experiences exploring various places. Points represent the “currency” of the game.</p>
    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>This is the first very long assignment. I felt the importance and convenience of many of the tips in tutorials and classes. For example, the “grey box” and splitting sketch into several different files effectively helped me not to get lost.
        The difficulty I encountered while doing this assignment was that I sometimes made typos or was not case-sensitive, which resulted in many errors that I ended up spending a lot of time checking and correcting. In fact, this might have been reduced if I had been more careful when writing the first time.</p>
