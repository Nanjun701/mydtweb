    <h5>Project 4: Exquisite Corpse</h5>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The finished program is a cat's head and the lower half of a bear. Even though such existences are ridiculous, they are justified by the presence of the projector, which just does randomized pairings.
    </p>
    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>I think what makes it difficult for me is using the curveVertex function to draw irregular shapes, such as a cat's nose. I need to try a lot. And on completion I found the various values very complex, perhaps in the future I could try to use algebra as much as possible.</p>
