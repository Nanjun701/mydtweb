    <h5>Project 5: Optical Illusion</h5>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I am getting into psychotherapy, and I feel very relaxed when I'm in the counseling room. Their environment is usually very comfortable, accompanied by soothing music. What I want to create is a display that helps patients relax in such an environment. I hope it can produce gentle, soothing waves. </p>
    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>I initially tried using the translate function, but it didn't achieve the effect I expected. I used ChatGPT to help me and learned that I could try using the sin function. After some adjustments, I finally achieved the effect I was hoping for.</p>
